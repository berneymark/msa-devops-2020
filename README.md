## Build and Release Pipelines
Each pipeline runs when a new commit is pushed to the master branch. With the Release Pipeline: this allows for the final code on the master branch to be instantly deployed online, for the customer to see. When ever work done is finalised it is automatically deployed online. The build pipeline is set to run on every commit as to constantly be built so that the developer can be aware of any errors or problems that could arise and need to be fixed.
